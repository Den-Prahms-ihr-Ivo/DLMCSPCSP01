# Debt Simplification Project â€“ DMCSPCSP01

This repository contains the source code for the **Debt Simplification Project**, developed as part of the Computer Science Project (DLMCSPCSP01).

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv <environment_name>
```

### 2. Activate the Environment

```bash
source <path_to_environment>/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install third-party libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Test Suite

From the root directory, run:

```bash
pytest
```

## Running the Project

A command-line interface has not been implemented. To run the project with a custom `.csv` file, simply update the `main.py` script with the desired input path.

Once configured, you can run the program with:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

This should allow for straightforward execution and adaptation to your own test data.
